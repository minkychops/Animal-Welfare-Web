<H2 style="text-align:center; color:yellow">Animal welfare means how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well-nourished, safe, able to express innate behavior, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear, and distress. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, humane handling, and humane slaughter. Animal welfare refers to the state of the animal; the treatment that an animal receives is covered by other terms such as animal care, animal husbandry, and humane treatment. Protecting an animal's welfare means providing for its physical and mental needs.</H2>

<H2 style="text-align:center; color:yellow">Ensuring animal welfare is a human responsibility that includes consideration for all aspects of animal well-being, including proper housing, management, nutrition, disease prevention and treatment, responsible care, humane handling, and, when necessary, humane euthanasia.<BR>

There are numerous perspectives on animal welfare that are influenced by a person's values and experiences. There are also various means of measuring animal welfare, including (but not limited to) health, productivity, behavior, and physiological responses.</H2><HR>

<TD><B><h2 style="color:orange"> Hey, it's great to see you visiting our site. I am MANAN SHARMA, a student of CHANDIGARH ENGINEERING COLLEGE, who is pursuing BTech in Computer Science. I  am an avid animal lover, and I see them as another soul, not to be hurt, but to be cared for, to enjoy life with. After all, the main goal in life is to spread love and nurture the beings God has put upon the earth! Now is the high time that the needs of the animals be addressed and they be cared for! We sternly believe that our mission has the potential to succeed and make a DIFFERENCE.</h2></B></TD>

Hey!welcome to our site which provides exhilarating content on one of the most hard-to-find topic nowadays, yes i MUKUL CHOPRA a student of CHANDIGARH ENGINEERING COLLEGE along with my 2 friends designed this website to throw some light on such a lavish topic of spreading awareness as well as knowledge about animal's care and their protection.It is such a cutthroat thing for us to share our content to next level for the sake of animal's wellness ,so to spread the information ,we decided to create a website, for nowadays people are more active on social media's platform rather than reading newspaper or other old means of gaining knowledge.. </h2></B></TD>


<TD><B><h2 style="color:forestgreen"> Myself 'NAMAN GUPTA' a student of CHANDIGARH ENGINEERING COLLEGE, Landran, Punjab. I am the person behind the idea of starting this awareness campaign. I started rescuing animals about 2 years ago most of which included dogs and pigeons. It's a wonderful journey . So I thought about starting a campaign so as to aware people to stop ignoring the animals in our surroundings who need care and do something for them. I wish most of you reading this will take an initiative of saving a life whenever you'll see an animal in need.</h2></B></TD>
